## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- React Query for server state (invitations, public groups)
- Redux for UI state (conversations, active chat)
- Socket.io for real-time updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search (500ms) in PublicGroupsDiscovery
- Query caching with 30s stale time for invitations
- Pagination for public groups (10 per page)
- Proper query invalidation to prevent stale data

### Error Handling
- API error responses shown via Mantine notifications
- Form validation before submission
- Capacity checks before sending invitations
- Socket error events handled gracefully

### Real-time Updates
- New invitations trigger badge update
- Accepted invitations immediately add conversation
- Member joins trigger conversation refresh
- All socket events properly typed

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue: `invitations.map is not a function`
**Problem:** Backend returns `{ success: true, data: [...] }` but frontend expected direct array

**Solution:** Updated all API methods to extract `data.data`:
```typescript
// Before
return data;

// After
return data.data; // Extract from wrapper object
```

Applied to:
- `getPendingInvitations()`
- `getPublicGroups()`
- `joinPublicGroup()`

## 📋 Testing Checklist

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server (already running)
cd server && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Client
cd client && npm run dev
```

### 2. Create Test Users
